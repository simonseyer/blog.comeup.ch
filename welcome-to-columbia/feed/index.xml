Cool, I didnâ€™t know that you lived in MedellÃ­n. Yeah, initially was a bit overwhelming but we quickly found our way around and then really enjoyed it!

I think we could see into the classrooms of the Uni from our hotel room^^

Nice to hear from you <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>

It has already been banned like 3 times though <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f648.png" alt="ðŸ™ˆ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />.
