We want to take spontaneous decisions, stay at places that we like, and leave the ones we don\u2019t. We want to follow the advice of locals and get inspired by the places we are instead of looking too far ahead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, we of course got some ideas that will guide us. I\u2019m writing this post on the plane to Panama City where our journey will start in about 10 hours. We aim to keep this the only flight of the trip until we head back. Which implies that we will be \u201climited\u201d to Central and South America. I\u2019m putting limited in quotes because it\u2019s a vast and diverse continent where we have no doubt we could spend well more than a year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.comeup.ch\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/20200410_140955.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.comeup.ch\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/20200410_140955-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Person on the ground with paraglider in the air on a grass field with sun shining\" class=\"wp-image-244\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.comeup.ch\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/20200410_140955-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/blog.comeup.ch\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/20200410_140955-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/blog.comeup.ch\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/20200410_140955-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/blog.comeup.ch\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/20200410_140955-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/blog.comeup.ch\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/20200410_140955-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/blog.comeup.ch\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/20200410_140955-1170x878.jpg 1170w, https:\/\/blog.comeup.ch\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/20200410_140955-1320x990.jpg 1320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Me handling my glider on the ground<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The single most influencing factor for our journey will be paragliding. Katy and I started to learn to fly together in 2018. Since then it has grown to be a very important part of our life. Important enough to even delay this sabbatical in order to learn to fly safely in foreign paragliding spots (in hindsight a great decision since the journey would have been stopped pretty abruptly by the Corona pandemic in 2020).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are very excited to visit a variety of paragliding spots, connect with the local pilots, expand our skills and experience the countries from a perspective only a few have the chance to. You also see this priority reflected in our <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.comeup.ch\/equipment\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"24\">equipment<\/a> where the paragliding gear is taking up about two-thirds of our luggage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.comeup.ch\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/DSC_0545.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.comeup.ch\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/DSC_0545-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Looking at a lake with a rocky shore and a palm tree\" class=\"wp-image-246\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.comeup.ch\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/DSC_0545-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/blog.comeup.ch\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/DSC_0545-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/blog.comeup.ch\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/DSC_0545-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/blog.comeup.ch\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/DSC_0545-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/blog.comeup.ch\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/DSC_0545-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/blog.comeup.ch\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/DSC_0545-1170x780.jpg 1170w, https:\/\/blog.comeup.ch\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/DSC_0545-1320x880.jpg 1320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Nkatha bay in Malawi where I spent two weeks during my Africa trip in 2015<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing that I quickly realized during my six-month trip to Africa in 2015 was that you can\u2019t be constantly on the move. For once, it\u2019s getting really exhausting and you have a hard time taking in new impressions. Secondly, the places where I stayed longer were often the ones I have the fondest memories of. You have a lot better chance to connect with the local community and experience the place on a different level. It\u2019s actually one of the big benefits compared to \u201cnormal\u201d vacations. So that\u2019s something that we will definitely keep in mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All that said, not everything can be decided\/booked spontaneously. That\u2019s something we got reminded of before even leaving Europe behind. Traveling south, which we consider our general direction for now, you need to get around the Dari\u00e9n Gap. That\u2019s ~100km of jungle that no road passes through and is mainly crossed by smugglers. Instead of taking one of the speed boats, we figured out that we could also take a sailboat that even visits the beautiful San Blas islands across a 5-day journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"962\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.comeup.ch\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/sailing-panama-colombia-20151.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Sail boat next to an island with a white sand beach\" class=\"wp-image-237\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.comeup.ch\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/sailing-panama-colombia-20151.jpg.webp 962w, https:\/\/blog.comeup.ch\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/sailing-panama-colombia-20151.jpg-300x140.webp 300w, https:\/\/blog.comeup.ch\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/sailing-panama-colombia-20151.jpg-768x359.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 962px) 100vw, 962px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The sailboat that will bring us to Columbia<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We booked this crossing a few days ago but only got a place on our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.avemariasailing.com\/\">preferred boat<\/a> on the 20th of February. That\u2019s longer than we think we want to stay in Panama where there are no great paragliding spots to our knowledge. So according to rule no. 1, we are now looking into visiting Costa Rica in the north before heading south.
