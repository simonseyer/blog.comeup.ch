After an awesome day of flying and many beers with the local pilots, Simon unfortunately flooded our new MacBook Air with water. The next day, he brought it to an Apple certified shop in Ecuadors capital Quito to assess the condition (an 8 hour roundtrip).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They now need 3 days (probably more because of Easter) to make an offer and then 10-15 days for (hopefully) fixing it. We expect that at least the display will need to be replaced because we saw water marks before turning it off. At the shop the display didn\u2019t even turn on anymore. We will see how much it will cost us. Either way, we will try to get it repaired or replaced. Continuing without a laptop is no option for us right now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without a laptop we can\u2019t transfer photos from our camera and blogging becomes very tedious. In the last two weeks we haven\u2019t been writing much anyway because we had a lot of great paragliding days and Simon continued working on <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/de\/app\/paraquip\/id1566910450?l=en\">Paraquip<\/a> (his iOS app for managing paragliding equipment, getting check notifications and calculating weight &amp; wing load). Without our laptop we will probably post even less, at least for another three weeks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will continue posting on <a href=\"http:\/\/Follow me and my travels on Polarsteps https:\/\/www.polarsteps.com\/SimonSeyer\">Polarsteps<\/a> though. Since I just talked to friends who frequently read our blog but weren\u2019t aware of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.polarsteps.com\/SimonSeyer\/6208274-america-del-sur\">Polarsteps<\/a>, this makes for the perfect opportunity to promote it again. We post there more often and it is more up to date, including our current location. Compared to the blog, pictures on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.polarsteps.com\/SimonSeyer\/6208274-america-del-sur\">Polarsteps<\/a> are taken with our smartphones (so not always the best quality) and it is more short-form (comparable to Twitter). But that makes it easier to just share snapshots, impressions, fun-facts and curiosities that may not fit into the narrative of a more polished blog post. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.polarsteps.com\/SimonSeyer\/6208274-america-del-sur\">Here is the link again in case you haven\u2019t found it yet<\/a>. Pro-tip: there are multiple pictures\/videos and when you click on them you see them in their original format (by default you only see a square cutout).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We hope we have a laptop available again soon and can share all those great pictures with you that we\u2019ve taken. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After Simon\u2019s vario (flight computer) died and I had to buy a new smartphone because the display of my old one suddenly stopped working, we now got our third electronics fallout.
